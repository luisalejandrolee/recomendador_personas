# sample each dataset to reduce and make it workable and write code easier.

# delete TIPO_ID and tipo_id2 and _NAME_ (use a function)

# convert PERIODO to date format (use a function)

# replace nas with zeros (create function. Also make some functions to give give median, etc)

# create lag variables for each (create function)
# create adquisition variables: when there's a new product (as a dummy) and when dropping one
# create lags for adquisition variables as well

# create target variable (function)

# Check and analyiza data
## check some stats (create shiny app!.. for time series)
## check correlations
## do a market basket analysis!

# are there products usually bought together?
# does it usually happen that when buying a credit card, another product is always owned?
